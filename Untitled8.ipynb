    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "Class is a user-defined datatype that contain its own data members and member functions. The member functions and data members can be\n",
    "accessed with the help of objects. It is the primary concept of object-oriented programming.  A class is used to organize information \n",
    "or data so a programmer can reuse the elements in multiple instances.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. As already mentioned above, all the data members and member functions of the class can be accessed \n",
    "with the help of objects.\n",
