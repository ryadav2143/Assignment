    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL (non-relational) database management system. It stores data in JSON-like documents \n",
    "with dynamic schemas, allowing flexibility and ease of handling complex data structures. MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple\n",
    "servers, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are a class of databases that do not follow the traditional relational data model. Unlike SQL\n",
    "databases (Relational databases), which store data in tables with predefined schemas and enforce relationships between tables, NoSQL databases \n",
    "store data in a more flexible and schema-less manner. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable\n",
    "for various data types, such as documents, key-value pairs, column-family, and graph data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "Flexible Schema: When your data structure is not well-defined or changes frequently, MongoDB's flexible schema allows you to store and modify \n",
    "data without the need to modify a predefined table structure, unlike SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, making it suitable for applications with high data volumes and traffic. It can\n",
    "distribute data across multiple nodes, ensuring better performance and handling large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data and Real-time Analytics: For applications that require real-time analytics and processing of massive volumes of data, MongoDB's \n",
    "ability to handle complex queries and indexes efficiently can be advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured Data: When dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data, like documents, arrays, or nested objects, MongoDB's document-oriented\n",
    "approach simplifies data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-Native Applications: MongoDB is well-suited for cloud environments due to its horizontal scaling capabilities, allowing applications to \n",
    "take advantage of cloud infrastructure efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapid Development: In scenarios where speed and agility are essential, MongoDB's flexible nature allows for faster development cycles and quick \n",
    "iteration of data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial Data: MongoDB has built-in geospatial queries, making it an excellent choice for applications that handle location-based data."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, where data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) documents. Each document can have\n",
    "a different structure, providing flexibility to handle evolving and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: MongoDB has a dynamic schema, meaning documents in a collection can have different fields and data types. This allows \n",
    "developers to change the data model without the need to modify the entire database schema, making it easy to adapt to changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or nodes. This enables it to handle large volumes\n",
    "of data and high throughput, making it suitable for applications with high growth and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, which are a group of database nodes that maintain identical data copies. If a primary node fails,\n",
    "a secondary node can take over, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Sharding: MongoDB supports automatic sharding, a technique that distributes data across multiple shards (partitions) to achieve horizontal\n",
    "scaling. It automatically balances data across shards as the data grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes: MongoDB allows the creation of indexes on fields in documents to optimize query performance. Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval \n",
    "and support complex queries efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows users to perform data transformation, filtering, grouping, \n",
    "and computation within the database. This is useful for real-time analytics and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries: MongoDB supports dynamic and ad hoc queries, enabling users to perform queries on documents using a flexible query language \n",
    "without needing to predefine specific indexes or structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial Indexes and Queries: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data. It can store and query location-based information, making it \n",
    "ideal for applications that deal with geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full-Text Search: MongoDB offers full-text search capabilities, allowing users to search for text content efficiently within documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption and Security: MongoDB provides features like field-level encryption, SSL/TLS support, access control, and authentication mechanisms \n",
    "to ensure data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native JSON Support: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like BSON format, making it easy to work with modern web applications that use JSON extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change Streams: MongoDB supports change streams, which allow applications to subscribe to real-time data changes in the database, enabling reactive\n",
    "programming and event-driven architectures."
