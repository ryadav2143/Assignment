    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "Ans:In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments - the filename (with the path if it's not in the current directory)\n",
    "    and the mode in which the file is to be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "r: Read mode - It opens the file for reading, and it's the default mode if no mode is specified. If the file doesn't exist, it raises an error.\n",
    "w: Write mode - It opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file doesn't exist, it creates\n",
    "                a new file.\n",
    "a: Append mode - It opens the file for appending. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. The new data is added at the end of the file.\n",
    "x: Exclusive creation mode - It opens the file for writing, but it fails if the file already exists.\n",
    "t: Text mode - It opens the file in text mode, which is the default mode. It handles the file data as text and converts the data to Unicode.\n",
    "b: Binary mode - It opens the file in binary mode, which handles the file data as binary bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify multiple modes by combining them with a plus sign, such as r+ for read and write mode, w+ for write and read mode, \n",
    "and a+ for append and read mode."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "Ans:In Python, the close() function is used to close a file that was opened using the open() function. When you're done working with a file, \n",
    "you should always close it using the close() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: When you open a file, the operating system allocates resources to it. If you don't close the file, these resources will remain\n",
    "allocated until the program exits, which can cause resource depletion or slowdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity: If you don't close a file properly, data may not be written to the file buffer completely, leading to data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "File locking: In some operating systems, files may remain locked even after the program that opened them exits. This can prevent other programs \n",
    "from accessing the file, leading to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, closing a file using the close() function is important to release "
