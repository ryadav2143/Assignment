    "1. what is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python?\n",
    "Ans:Multithreading is a programming technique in which multiple threads of execution are created within a single process, allowing for concurrent\n",
    "execution of multiple tasks. In Python, multithreading is achieved through the threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads are lightweight and allow for faster execution of tasks as they can run concurrently. Multithreading is used to increase the efficiency\n",
    "of a program, especially when dealing with tasks that are I/O bound. For example, when waiting for a network response or reading data from a file,\n",
    "the main thread can continue executing other tasks while waiting for the I/O operation to complete, rather than blocking and waiting\n",
    "for the I/O operation to finish.\n",

    "The threading module in Python provides a simple way to create and manage threads. It allows for creating new threads, starting and\n",
    "stopping them, and synchronizing their execution. The module also provides several synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, \n",

    "\n",

    "join() - This method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When the join() method is called on a thread, the \n",

    "Increased efficiency: Multithreading can improve the overall performance of a program by utilizing multiple processors or cores. This can result\n",
    "in faster execution of tasks and improved system responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved resource utilization: Multithreading can help a program make better use of system resources such as memory and I/O devices by allowing \n",
    "different threads to perform different tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified program design: Multithreading can make it easier to design and implement complex programs, as different parts of the program can \n",
    "be divided into separate threads, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better user experience: Multithreading can improve the user experience of a program by making it more responsive and less likely to hang or\n",
    "freeze.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity: Multithreading can make a program more complex and difficult to debug, as different threads may interact with each other\n",
    "in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization issues: Multithreading can introduce synchronization issues, where different threads may access the same data or resources \n",
    "simultaneously, leading to race conditions and other errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased overhead: Multithreading can introduce additional overhead, as the operating system must manage multiple threads of execution, leading\n",
    "to increased memory and CPU usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging difficulties: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more difficult than single-threaded programs because the exact sequence of events\n",
    "is harder to predict and the timing of events can vary depending on the operating system and other factors."
