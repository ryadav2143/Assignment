    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    " Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a countable number of distinct values.\n",
    "It gives the probability that a discrete random variable equals a specific value.\n",
    "The PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where X is the random variable and x is a specific value.\n",
    "The sum of all PMF values over all possible values of the random variable should equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of a single roll of the die. The PMF for\n",
    "this random variable is as follows:\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "In this example, the PMF gives the probability of getting each of the six possible outcomes when rolling the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "PDF is used for continuous random variables, which can take on an infinite number of values within a range.\n",
    "It represents the probability distribution of a continuous random variable by specifying the likelihood of the variable\n",

    "The PDF for this random variable might be modeled as follows:\n",
    "f(y) = k * e^(-0.2y), for y ≥ 0\n",
    "In this equation, f(y) is the PDF, and k is a constant chosen to ensure that the total area under the PDF curve\n",

    "F(y) = 0.9 for 70 ≤ y < 75\n",
    "F(y) = 1 for y ≥ 75\n",
    "\n",

    "F(62) = 0.6, which means there is a 60% chance that an adult male's height is less than or equal to 62 inches.\n",
    "F(70) = 0.9, indicating a 90% chance that an adult male's height is less than or equal to 70 inches.\n",

    "How Parameters Shape the Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (μ): The mean is the central value of the distribution. It determines the location of the peak or center of the bell curve.\n",
    "If μ increases, the peak shifts to the right, and if μ decreases, it shifts to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data. A larger σ results in a wider,\n",
