    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Ans:When creating a custom exception in Python, it is best practice to use the Exception class as the base class for the custom exception.\n",
    "This is because the Exception class provides a consistent and well-defined interface for handling errors, and it includes important methods\n",
    "such as __str__() and __repr__(), which are used to provide a human-readable string representation of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, using the Exception class as the base class for a custom exception allows it to be caught by any generic exception handling code \n",
    "that catches instances of the base Exception class. This means that code that handles exceptions will be able to handle the custom exception\n",
    "in the same way as built-in exceptions, making it easier to write robust and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the Exception class as the base class for a custom exception ensures that the custom exception will be compatible with \n",
    "other Python libraries and frameworks that expect exceptions to follow the standard Python exception hierarchy. This can help to ensure that \n",
    "the custom exception is easily understood and used by other developers who may encounter it."

    "Don't use exceptions for flow control: Exceptions should be used for handling errors, not for flow control. Using exceptions for flow control can make your code harder to read and debug.\n",
