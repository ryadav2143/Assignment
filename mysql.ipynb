    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval\n",
    "and manipulation of data. Databases are essential components in modern software applications, as they provide a reliable and scalable\n",
    "way to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are structured databases, which means they follow a predefined schema. The schema defines the tables, columns,\n",
    "and relationships between data, enforcing data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with SQL databases. It is a standard language for managing relational \n",
    "databases and performing operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases use a tabular data model where data is stored in rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and \n",
    "each column represents a field in the record.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL,  Oracle, SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational databases, meaning they do not have a fixed schema. They allow for flexible data structures,\n",
    "enabling developers to store unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "Language: NoSQL databases typically use various data access mechanisms, and they may not require a specific query language like \n",
    "SQL. Some NoSQL databases provide their own query languages or APIs.\n",
    "Data Model: NoSQL databases support various data models, such as key-value, document, column-family, and graph. This allows them to \n",
    "handle diverse data types more efficiently than traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB"

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of \n",
    "a database and its objects. DDL commands are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects like tables, indexes,\n",
    "views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or schemas. It specifies the name of the \n",
    "object and its structure. Here's an example of creating a simple table in an SQL database:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    department VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "In this example, we are creating a table named \"employees\" with four columns: \"id,\" \"name,\" \"age,\" and \"department.\" The \"id\" column is \n",
    "designated as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "The DROP command is used to delete existing database objects. It permanently removes the object and its data from the database.\n",
    "Here's an example of dropping the previously created \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "After executing this command, the \"employees\" table and all its data will be removed from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can add, modify, or delete columns from a table, \n",
    "change data types, or rename objects. Here's an example of altering the \"employees\" table to add a new column:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "In this example, we are adding a new column named \"email\" to the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. Unlike the DROP command, TRUNCATE \n",
    "does not delete the table itself; it only removes the data within it. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "After executing this command, all data in the \"employees\" table will be removed, but the table structure will remain."

    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data stored in a \n",
    "database. DML commands allow users to insert, update, retrieve, and delete data from database tables. Unlike DDL, which deals with the \n",
    "structure of the database, DML focuses on the actual data within the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT:\n",
    "The INSERT command is used to add new records (rows) into a table. It allows you to specify the values for each column when inserting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 'HR');\n",

    "\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET age = 35\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "In this example, we are updating the \"age\" column of the employee with ID 1, setting it to 35.\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row (record) in the table. It serves as a unique\n",
    "identifier for each record, and no two records in the table can have the same primary key value. In other words, a primary key uniquely \n",

    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique.\n",

    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables. It creates a relationship\n",

    "It references the primary key of another table, creating a link between the two tables.\n",
    "It can contain NULL values, representing cases where a related record may not exist.\n",

    "Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method?\n",

    "    To connect MySQL to Python, you need to use a MySQL database connector. One popular choice is the \"mysql-connector-python\" library.\n",
    "Before running the code, make sure you have installed the library using pip:\n",

    "After executing all the queries, we commit the changes to the database using connection.commit() because it's required for INSERT, UPDATE,\n",
